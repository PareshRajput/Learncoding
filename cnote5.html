<h3>What is a function?</h3>
<p class="p">
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task.<br>
Every C++ program has at least one function, which is main( ), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.<br>
You can divide up your code into separate functions.<br>

How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division usually is such that each function performs a specific task.<br>
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.<br>
A C++ function definition consists of a function header and a function body.<br>

Here are all the parts of a function-<br>
Declaration:<br>
the function's name, return type, and parameters (if any)
Definition:<br>
the body of the function (code to be executed)
