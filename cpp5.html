<center>••FUNCTION IN C++••</center></h1>

<b>What is a function?</b><br>

A function is a group of statements that together perform a task.
Every C++ program has at least one function, which is main( ), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions.
You can divide up your code into separate functions.<br><br>

How you divide up your code among different functions is up to you, but logically the division usually is such that each function performs a specific task.
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
A C++ function definition consists of a function header and a function body.<br><br>

<b>Here are all the parts of a function-</b>
Declaration:<br>
the function's name, return type, and parameters (if any)<br>
Definition:<br>
the body of the function (code to be executed)<br>
